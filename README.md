Greetings.  Welcome to my PixyCam Follower Project.  This is an attempt at using a beaglebone, pixycam, and vex kit to make a small robot.

The hope is that we learn how to use PID control to have the robot follow an object.  Then, we will apply this tech to our FRC robot using network tables and/ or cscore.

So far, we are using robotpy to drive the robot and the python wrapper for PixyCam.  This is a python3 endeavor.
